# Scrobbler Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Scrobbler for mobile devices, that was created by Filipe Tavares.

The application downloads the public Discogs collection for the Discogs username that is provided by the user. The data that is retrieved from Discogs is only kept in memory while the application is open, and is not copied or stored anywhere else.

The Last.fm account is used only for the purpose of submitting tracks to Last.fm (a.k.a. scrobbling). The Last.fm password is not stored in the application or anywhere else, and is only used once, after entered by the user, to initialize a session with Last.fm, after which it is forgotten by the application.

No personally identifiable information is collected.

## Google Analytics

The application collects anonymous usage data through Google Analytics, for the purpose of understanding the most common usage patterns to further inform future development. This is limited to collecting which features are used, performance metrics, and crash/error data. This analytics data is fully anonymized: no user identifiers are collected, no device identifiers are collected, no cookies are used, and even the IP address is anonymized. No personally identifiable information is collected.
