# Athletic Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Athletic for mobile devices that was created by Filipe Tavares.

The application accesses workout data from Apple's HealthKit, but only for display purposes in the application, and to check for goal progress and completion status. The workout data that is retrieved from HealthKit is only kept in memory while the application is open, and is not copied or stored anywhere else.

The user can create a workout routine and custom goals in the application, but that data is only stored locally in the mobile device where the application is installed. The data kept in the local storage of the application will be deleted once the application is deleted from that mobile device.

No personally identifiable information is collected.

## Google Analytics

The application collects anonymous usage data through Google Analytics, for the purpose of understanding the most common usage patterns to further inform future development. This is limited collecting which features and activity types are used. This analytics data is fully anonymized: no user identifiers are collected, no device identifiers are collected, no cookies are used, and even the IP address is anonymized. No personally identifiable information is collected.
